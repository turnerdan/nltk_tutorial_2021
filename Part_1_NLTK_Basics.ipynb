    "These were downloaded from Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org), a website that hosts a library of over 60,000 free books. Many of these books are available in plaintext (.txt) format, making them easilly parsable by packages like NLTK. That said, the skills from this workshop are broadly applicable to any type and format of machine-readable text, not just books from Project Gutenburg and not just plaintext.\n",

In most cases, this process only takes one line of code and a few minutes. You can find instructions here: https://www.nltk.org/install.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Installing other packages.*\n",
    "Other packages required in this workshop are **numpy**, **pickle**, **os**, **re**, **string**, **scipy**, and **pyplot**. Like NLTK, they are preinstalled on this server, but if you want to run these scripts on a different machine, you will need to install these packages.\n",
